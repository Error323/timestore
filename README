BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

It is intended that autotools will be used to manage the build process, but
for the time being just run "make" in this directory and copy the resulting
binary from "src/timestore" to a convenient location.

The package contains a bundled version of libmicrohttpd, which will be built
automatically.  It is statically linked and not installed separately.

The server should be started as root.  It will attempt to become a user
called "timestore", which must have write access to the location
/var/lib/timestore.  Both the user and database path can be changed through
command line options.  There is no support for a configuration file yet.

For testing the -d switch can be used to prevent the program from becoming a
daemon.  In this case the user will not be changed either.
